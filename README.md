# R Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization projects completed using **R**. The projects reflect academic coursework, personal experiments, and real-world applications of R in areas such as predictive modeling, feature engineering, and data storytelling.

## Project Highlights

### Movie ROI Prediction
Predicts the return on investment (ROI) for movies using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Multiple Linear Regression. Includes feature importance analysis and performance visualization.


## Tools & Packages Used

- `tidyverse` (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, readr)
- `caret` for model training and evaluation
- `randomForest`, `xgboost`, `lm`, `forecast`
- `ggplot2`, `plotly` for data visualization
- `lubridate`, `stringr`, and other utility packages

## Structure

Each project is organized into its own folder and includes:
- `.R` scripts for analysis and modeling
- `README.md` (project-specific summaries)
- Data files (if publicly shareable)
- Outputs: charts, model metrics, etc.

## Getting Started

To run any project:
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open the project folder in RStudio.
3. Make sure you have the required libraries installed (see top of each script).
4. Run scripts in order or use the `.Rproj` file if provided.
